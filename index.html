                        Hi I'm Viorel!<br><br>

                        I'm a student at the University of Bucharest, preparing to become an engineer!<br>

                        I am also a volunteer in the Student's Association at Mathematics & Computer Science!<br><br>
                        In my free time I play drums and study about life's most interesting aspects; whether good or bad.<br>
                        I also enjoy studying about Science and Literature, Psychology and Philosophy.

                    <p>This website was made as minimalist as possible,
                        using only basic <b>HTML</b> tags and "prettifying" it with <b>CSS</b>.
                        <br>The flow of the page is implemented with plain <b>JavaScript</b>.
                        <br><br> I tried to give it a Material Design look as

                        My experience in working with databases is limited to simple SQL
                        queries, but I wish to exchange that with a proper training in using
                        NoSQL Databases like MongoDB or Neo4j.</p>

                        As a volunteer, I have accomplished a great number of tasks;

                        a national contest throughout numerous universities from Romania.<br><br>

            <p>LRobot is a next-gen robot which can move around a room, identify people
                and memorise who they are!
                <br>My job on this project was to implement how it shows it's emotions;
                I used the Java Swing API to draw it's face and Java to change his facial
                expressions when the backend would ask so.</p>

                Before starting development, I found this as being a perfect opportunity
                to learn how to implement the features required using MVC.
                <br>
                I used JavaFX to implement my views,
                the controller was made up of Java methods and API calls from JDBC for all my queries.<br>
                The Model was made up of classes which built up all the entities within the database.</p>
